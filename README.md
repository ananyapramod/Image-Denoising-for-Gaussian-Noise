<h1>An Approach to Image Denoising using Autoencoders and Spatial Filters for Gaussian Noise</h1>

At a prime age in data science where information extracted from a large variety of data sources for text, numbers, images and other media drive a lot of research and analysis, the need for having clean data is important. Accumulation and extraction of pure and specific data from such sources is an important stage in this area in order to avoid losing even small amounts of information and to achieve desirable performance. Hence, it is important to consider variations, noise and other such flaws in the data sources in order to properly pre-process the data. The work done focuses specifically on handling the case of noise in acquired images that will be used in specific domains like text extraction from images, object detection, image classification etc. The work proposes a denoising pipeline involving spatial filters and deep autoencoder networks aimed to remove Gaussian noise in image data while minimising cost and complexity of the process to achieve high performance in  computer vision tasks on such denoised data. The work  also provides an empirical analysis on the results obtained and discusses important trends observed. Image data that is abundantly available can be put to good use by the proposed denoising pipeline which enhances machine interpretation of such data. Better performance on computer vision tasks is achieved with reduced time and computational power.
